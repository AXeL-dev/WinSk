Native client/server allowing you to control computer(s) remotely (don't think it is an RDP, i don't use any protocols here except socket)

- the current version of project contains:

+ client & server written in C.
+ an android server written in Java (using Android Studio 2.3).

feel free to use/modify it.

PS: sorry for the comment language < French />, this is one of my oldest project and i wasn't so familiar with english (i think it still the same case..)
